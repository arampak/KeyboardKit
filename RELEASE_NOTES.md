# Release Notes


## 2.3.0

This version adds autocomplete support, which includes an autocomplete suggestion provider protocol, a new toolbar and new extensions.

The new `AutocompleteSuggestionProvider` protocol describes how to provide your keyboard with autocomplete suggestions. You can implement it in any way you like, e.g. to use a built-in suggestion database or by connecting to an external data source, using network requests. Note that the network option will be a lot slower and also require you to request full access from your users.

The new `AutocompleteToolbar` is a toolbar that can display any results you receive from your suggestion provider (or any list of strings for that matter). Just trigger the provider anyt√≠me the text changes and route the result to the toolbar. The toolbar can be populated with any kind of views. Have a look at the demo app for an example.

The new `UITextDocumentProxy+CurrentWord` extension helps you get the word that is (most probably) being typed. You could use this when requesting autocomplete suggestions, if you only want to autocomplete the current word.

Besides these additions, there are a bunch of new extensions, like `UITextDocumentProxy` `deleteBackwards(times:)`, which lets you delete a certain number of characters. Have a look at the `Extensions` namespace for a complete list.

There is also a new `KeyboardShiftState` enum that you can use to keep track of which state your keyboard has, if any. This enum is extracted from demo app code that was provided by @arampak earlier this year. 

 **IMPORTANT** iOS has a bug that causes `textWillChange` and `textDidChange` to not be called when the user types, only when the cursor moves. This causes autocomplete problems, since the current word is not changing as the user types. Due to this, the input view controller must use an ugly hack to force the text document proxy to update. Have a look at the demo app to see how this is done.


## 2.2.1

This version solves some major bugs in the repeating gesture recognizer and makes some `public` parts of the library `open`.

The standard action handler now handles repeating actions for backspace. You can customize this in the same way as you customize tap and long press handling.

You can test the new repeating logic in the demo app.


## 2.2.0

This version adds more keyboard actions that don't exist in iOS, but that may serve a functional or semantical purpose in your apps:

* `command`
* `custom(name:)`
* `escape`
* `function`
* `option`
* `tab`

The new `custom` action is a fallback that you can use if the existing action set is insufficient for your specific app.

I have added a `RepeatingGestureRecognizer` and an extension that you can use to apply it as well. It has a custom initial delay as well as a custom repeat interval, that will let you tap and hold a button to repeat its action. In the next update, I will apply this to the backspace and arrow buttons.

Thanks to [@arampak](https://github.com/arampak), the demo app now handles shift state and long press better, to make the overall experience much nicer and close to the native keyboard. The keyboard buttons also registers tap events over the entire button area, not just the button view.


## 2.1.0

This version makes a bunch of previously internal extensions public. It also adds a lot more unit tests so that almost all parts of the library are tested.

The default tap animation has been configured to allow user interaction, which reduces the frustrating tap lag that was present in 2.0.0.

I have added a `KeyboardToolbar` class, which you can use to create toolbars. It's super simple so far, and only creates a stack view to which you can any views you like.


## 2.0.1

This version adds a public shadow extension to the main library and shuffles classes and extensions around. It also restructures the example project to make it less cluttered.

I noticed that the build number bump still (and randomly) bumps the build number incorrectly, which causes build errors. I have therefore abandoned this approach, and instead fixes the build number to 1 in all targets.


## 2.0.0

This version aim at streamlining the library and remove or refactor parts that make it hard to maintain. It contains several breaking changes, but I hope that the changes will make it easier for you as well, as the library moves forward.

Most notably, the view controller inheritance model has been completely removed. Instead, there is only one `KeyboardInputViewController`. It has a stack view to which you can add any views you like, like the built-in `KeyboardButtonRow` and `KeyboardCollectionView`, which means that your custom keyboards is now based on components that you can combine.

Since `KeyboardInputViewController` therefore can display multiple keyboards at once, it doesn't make any sense to have a single `keyboard` property. You can still use structs to organize your actions (in fact, I recommend it - have a look at the demo app), but you don't have to.

All action handling has been moved from the view controller to `KeyboardActionHandler` as well. `KeyboardInputViewController` use a `StandardActionHandler` by default, but you can replace this by setting `keyboardActionHandler` to any `KeyboardActionHandler`. This is required if you want to use certain actions types, like `.image`.

New `KeyboardAction`s are added and `nextKeyboard` has been renamed to `switchKeyboard`. Action equality logic has also been removed, so instead of `isNone`, you should use `== .none` from now on. All help properties like `image` and `imageName` are removed as well, since they belong in the app. These are the new action types

* capsLock
* dismissKeyboard
* moveCursorBackward
* moveCursorForward
* shift
* shiftDown
* switchToKeyboard(type)

`KeyboardInputViewController` will now resize the extension to the size of the stack view, or any other size constraints you may set. The old `setHeight(to:)` function has therefore been removed.


## 1.0.0

This version upgrades `KeyboardKit` to Swift 5 and has many breaking changes:

 * `KeyboardInputViewController` has been renamed to `KeyboardViewController`
 * `CollectionKeyboardInputViewController` has been renamed to `CollectionKeyboardViewController`
 * `GridKeyboardInputViewController` has been renamed to `GridKeyboardViewController`
 * `KeyboardAlerter` has been renamed to `KeyboardAlert`
 * `ToastAlerter` has been renamed to `ToastAlert`
 * `ToastAlert` now has two nested view classes `View` and `Label`
 * `ToastAlert`'s two style function has changed signature
 * `ToastAlerterAppearance` is now an internal `ToastAlert.Appearance` struct
 * Most extensions have been made internal, to avoid exposing them externally


## 0.8.0

`Keyboard` has been given an optional ID, which can be used to uniquely identify a keyboard. This makes it easier to manage multiple keyboards in an app.

`KeyboardInputViewController` implements the `KeyboardPresenter` protocol, which means that you can set the new optional `id` property to make a `KeyboardSetting` exclusive to that presenter. This is nice if your app has multiple keyboards. If you do not specify an id, the settings behave just like before.

A PR by [micazeve](https://github.com/micazeve) is merged. It limits the current page index that is persisted for a keyboard, to avoid bugs if the page count has changed since persisting the value.


## 0.7.1

This version updates KeyboardKit to `Swift 4.2` and makes it ready for Xcode 10.


## 0.7.0

The grid keyboard view controller uses a new way to calculate the available item space and item size for a certain number of rows and buttons per row. This means that we can now use top and bottom content insets to create vertical margins for grid-based keyboards.


## 0.6.2

I previously used the async image functions to quickly setup a lot of images for "emoji" keyboards. Since I didn't use a collection view for emoji keyboards then, all image views were created at the same time, which caused rendering delays. By using the async image approach, image loading was moved from the main thread and allowed individual images to appear when they were loaded instead of waiting for all images to load before any image could be displayed.

However, `KeyboardKit` now has collection view-based keyboards, which are better suited for the task above, since they only render the cells they need. This will solve the image loading issues, which means that the async image extensions will no longer be needed. I have therefore removed `UIImage+Async` and the `Threading` folder from the library, to keep it as small as possible.


## 0.6.1

No functional changes, just README updates and improvements. The version bump is required to give CocoaPod users the latest docs.


## 0.6.0

This is a complete rewrite of the entire library. KeyboardKit now targets iOS 11 and the code has been improved a lot. Check out the demo app to see how to setup keyboards from now on.
